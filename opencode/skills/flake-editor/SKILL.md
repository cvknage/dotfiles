description: Guide creation and improvement of Nix flakes, including inputs, outputs, and version pinning.

## What I do

Help structure, clean up, and optimize Nix flakes:

1. Organize inputs and lock files.
2. Define outputs (`devShells`, `packages`, `nixosConfigurations`).
3. Pin versions and keep reproducibility.
4. Make examples easy to import or run.

## When to use me

Use this when the user asks about:
- Creating a new flake.
- Refactoring an existing flake.
- Adding support for multiple systems or outputs.
- Managing inputs and dependency pinning.

Ask for the intended usage and target systems if unclear.
