## What I do

When given an error trace from Nix evaluation or build:

1. Identify where and why the error occurred.
2. Point to the minimal code fragment responsible.
3. Suggest a clear fix with a short, tested snippet.
4. Explain why the fix resolves the issue.

## When to use me

Use this skill whenever:
- The user supplies a Nix error log.
- A package build fails with unclear context.
- Evaluation errors occur in overlays or flake contexts.

Ask for full logs and repository context if needed.
