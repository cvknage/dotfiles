## What I do

When asked about a NixOS option (e.g., services, system settings, module options), consult MCP‑NixOS first.

1. Validate that the option exists.
2. Return its type, default value, and documentation summary.
3. Provide a minimal example of how to define it in a NixOS configuration.
4. Suggest close matches if the exact option isn’t found.

## When to use this skill

Use this whenever the user wants to find, validate, or understand a NixOS option.

Ask clarifying questions if the channel, version, or target platform isn’t specified.
